Hey, I'm Ashley. How are you doing today?

I am currently a 2nd-year master's student in Education Data Science at Stanford Graduate School of Education. My current research looks into the languages used in virtual tutoring settings and explores the potentials of informing tutor training and improving tutor quality. The research was motivated by my work experience in one of the largest tutoring service companies.

I was born and raised in Suzhou, China and came to the United States for my undergraduate education. From a young age, I have been naturally drawn to the underdog. In high school, I got to spend more time volunteering in the underrepresented communities; some of the moments have left indelible imprints.

I was nurtured well both intellectually and experientially during my time at New York University. Some of my personal highlights included

- using machine learning to understand human cognition about group
- got introduced to machine learning, natural language processing, and causal inference
- worked on evaluating education policy at New York City Department of Education
- tutored at P.S.2; visited Brooklyn and Bronx P.S. frequently for data collection
- heard the voice of domestic violence survivors at Manhattan Family Justice Center
- visited Ghana
- took "German Intellectual Tradition: Marx, Nietzsche, & Freud" when studying abroad in Berlin
