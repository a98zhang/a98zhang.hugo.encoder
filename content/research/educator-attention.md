abstract: "Educator attention is critical for student success, yet how educators distribute their attention across students remains poorly understood. This study presents the first large-scale computational analysis of educator attention patterns, leveraging over 1 million educator utterances from virtual group tutoring sessions. Using NLP, we find that while educators often attend more to lower-achieving students, significant disparities emerge by gender — girls receive less attention than boys even when they are the lower-achieving student in the pair."

Educator attention — who teachers direct their time, questions, and feedback toward — is one of the most consequential resources in a classroom, yet its distribution remains largely unmeasured at scale.

This paper presents the **first large-scale computational analysis of educator attention patterns**, using a dataset of over **1 million educator utterances** from virtual group tutoring sessions linked to detailed student demographic and academic achievement records.

Using natural language processing, we systematically examine both the *recipient* and the *nature* of educator attention across sessions.

#### What we find

- Educators tend to provide more attention to **lower-achieving students** overall — consistent with an equity-minded instinct
- But **gender disparities** emerge: girls receive significantly less attention than boys when paired together, even when the girl is the lower-achieving student in the group
- Lower-achieving female students in mixed-gender pairs are the most underserved group

#### Why it matters

These findings show that well-intentioned attention allocation can still produce inequitable outcomes along gender lines. Computational tools offer a scalable way to surface these patterns — and, eventually, to help educators correct them in real time.
