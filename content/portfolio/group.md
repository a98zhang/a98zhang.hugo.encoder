What is a **group**? How our human beings conceive a **group**? 

In this era of drastic changes in societal and political landscapes, we need an answer on these questions, more than ever. **Machine learning** may offer a new perspecitve on this classic **social psychology** question.

Social and industrial psychologists have long been interested in **groups**. Yet, the term group is applied to a wide variety of examples, including racial groups (e.g., Asians, Whites, Blacks), work groups (e.g., coworkers, committees), hobby groups (e.g., knitting circle, soccer team), and even loose collectives (e.g., people at a bus stop).

This [research project](https://github.com/a98zhang/What-is-a-group) disects the abstract theoretical psychology question of *how does human being cognitively represent social groups through a taxonomy* with the help of machine learning techniques (`k-means clustering`, `PCA`, `LASSO Regression`).  

#### Form and function: A new framework

We find that people organize their taxonomy of social groups along two dimensions: the *form* of a group (e.g., the size, the stability), and the *function* of a group (e.g., having a common goal).

#### Cross Cultural Comparisons

Comparing an American sample and an Indian sample, we find distinctive discrepancies in how people from different cultures conceptualize certain groups.
