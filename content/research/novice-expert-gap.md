Scaling high-quality tutoring remains a major challenge in education. Due to growing demand, many platforms employ novice tutors who, unlike experienced educators, struggle to address student mistakes and thus fail to seize prime learning opportunities.

We propose to close this novice-expert gap by developing models of expert decision-making and using them to train novice tutors. Our case study focuses on **remediating math mistakes** — a critical moment in tutoring that novices often handle poorly. We introduce a framework that:

1. Learns from expert tutors' remediation strategies
2. Models the decision-making process behind effective feedback
3. Surfaces targeted guidance for novice tutors in real time

Our approach demonstrates that computational models of expert decision-making can meaningfully improve novice tutoring quality — a step toward scalable, high-quality math education.
