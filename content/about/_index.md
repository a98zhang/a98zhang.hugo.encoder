Hey, I'm Ashley.
How are you doing today?

We are now living in the sea of data.
And I aspire to be the swim coach that save you from drowning.

![This is me][1]

An Applied Psychology and Computer Science double major, I have extensive experience working with data from a well-rounded perspective: algorithms and models, machine learning at scale, but also cautious inference, human biases.

Utilizing my skills in research and analytics, I have helped organizations generate insights from data to make informed decisions. Meanwhile, as an independent researcher, I have attempted to investigate psychology research questions using machine learning techniques. 

In addition to honing skills in programming and analytics, I have also cultivated a human-centered perspective and user-focused mindset through internship in product management as well as voluntary work in social services.

I am always an eager learner, an effective communicator, a civic tech follower, and a child development enthusiast. Graduating this May, I am actively looking for opportunities in data analysis and product management. Please feel free to reach me qingyang.zhang@nyu.edu.
