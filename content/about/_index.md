Hey, I'm Ashley — a researcher and builder based in New York City.

I studied Applied Psychology and Computer Science at NYU, where I became interested in using quantitative and computational methods to ask questions about how people think, categorize, and make sense of the social world.

## Research

My work sits at the intersection of social cognition and machine learning. I'm drawn to questions like: how do people mentally organize social groups? How does culture shape those representations? I use both experimental methods and ML techniques — clustering, dimensionality reduction, regression — to investigate these.

## Building

Outside of research, I enjoy making things: data stories, small tools, experiments in code. I'm drawn to projects where the goal is to make something complex more legible, or where I just want to see what happens when you try.
